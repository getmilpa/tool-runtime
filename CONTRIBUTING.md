# Contributing to Milpa ToolRuntime

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Milpa ToolRuntime is the AI tool-execution
runtime of the Milpa framework — the registry pipeline (resolve → validate →
authorize → execute → audit), `#[Tool]` attributes, schema validation, policy gate,
rate limiting, channel rendering, and human verification. It builds on `milpa/core`:
attributes, interfaces, events, and the verification seam, with no product coupling.

## Getting started

```bash
composer install
vendor/bin/phpunit
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse src
php tools/validate-docblocks.php
```

These run in CI on PHP 8.3 and 8.4 (alongside `composer validate --strict` and a
`php -l` syntax pass); run them locally before opening a PR.

## Guidelines

- **PHP >= 8.3**, with `declare(strict_types=1);` in every file.
- **Document every public symbol.** A public class/interface/enum/trait or public
  method without a DocBlock summary fails CI (`tools/validate-docblocks.php`).
  Trivial accessors and magic methods are exempt.
- **Respect the tier boundary.** Milpa ToolRuntime depends on `milpa/core`, never the
  reverse. Do not introduce a dependency on Doctrine, a concrete container, or any
  product/plugin code, and do not push tool-runtime concerns down into the core.
- **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** — releases and
  the CHANGELOG are generated automatically from commit messages. Use
  `feat:` / `fix:` / `docs:` / `chore:` etc.; a breaking change to a public
  interface or capability schema is a `feat!:` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` (bumps MINOR
  while the package is `0.x`, MAJOR once it reaches `1.0`).

## Code style

The whole Milpa family (`milpa/core`, `milpa/http`, `milpa/tool-runtime`) shares one
coding standard, committed verbatim in every repo as `.php-cs-fixer.dist.php` and
enforced by CI. In short:

- **[PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) base**: 4 spaces (never tabs);
  opening braces on the **next line** for classes and methods, on the **same line**
  for control structures; one statement per line.
- **Family deltas on top of PSR-12**: short array syntax (`[]`), one space around
  string concatenation (`$a . $b`), fully-multiline method arguments when split,
  no unused imports, aligned/separated/trimmed PHPDoc tags, trailing commas in
  multiline constructs.

Check and fix locally before pushing:

```bash
vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --dry-run --diff   # what CI runs
vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix                    # apply
```

Do not tweak `.php-cs-fixer.dist.php` in one package alone — the standard changes
in lockstep across the family or not at all.

## Pull requests

Keep PRs focused, add tests for behavior changes, and make sure the four commands
above are green. A maintainer will review and, once merged to `main`,
release-please will handle versioning.

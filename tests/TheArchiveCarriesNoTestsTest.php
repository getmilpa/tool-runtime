/**
 * WHAT A HOUSE INSTALLS OF THIS PACKAGE CARRIES NO TESTS.
 *
 * Composer installs the archive of a tag, and git leaves out of an archive whatever `.gitattributes` marks
 * `export-ignore`. Until that line existed, a house that required this package received its tests too — as
 * many files as the code it runs, never run there, and with them whatever a test had been written with. One
 * line keeps them out, and nothing in the package held that line.
 *
 * @guards the tests being marked out of the archive, and the archive git builds carrying none
 *
 * @refuses nothing — it holds a line of `.gitattributes`
